# Python Project: BlackJack

I learned Python through watching pre-recorded classes online and a lot of practice. I wanted to play BlackJack with the computer and did so by creating four classes. For more details on the classes, please refer to the PPT.

### Problem Statement
Can I create a game to play BlackJack?
